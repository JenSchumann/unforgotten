# Unforgotten
### **A web application commemorating those lost in the Titanic disaster**

### **About:**

- Practice in utilizing the faceted search capability of AngularJS

### **Design:**

- HTML5/CSS integrated with Spectre framework

### **Planned Features:**

- [x] Area which displays all the items that match the current set of filters.

- [ ] Removable "chips" which serve as filterable categories which comprise the Titanic passenger data.

- [x] Display a count of items matching each value in that category. Need to update this to display the count only next to checked items.
